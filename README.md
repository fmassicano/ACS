# Attenuation Correction SPECT/PET (ACS)

## Summary

In order to obtain the functional information from Single Photom Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) images the Attenuation Correction SPECT (ACS) software has been developed. Using Chang’s method first order ACS performs the attenuation correction in SPECT images. As a output ACS creates the activity distribution within the patient that will be used for the Monte Carlo simulation for dose assessment.

To methodoly is described in the paper [Evaluation of Changs’s Attenuation Correction Method in the ACS Software](https://inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/43/046/43046267.pdf?r=1)

This software intend to be a plugin for [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).
